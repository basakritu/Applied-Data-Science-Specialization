This specialization is a part of Coursera projects - https://www.coursera.org/specializations/applied-data-science?

This specialization has 5 different courses. These courses include real-world projects using principal data science tools.

# Projects are the following:
# Python for Data Science, AI & Development:
In this project, we learn about different Python libraries like <b> Pandas, Numpy, and Beautifulsoup </b>. We practice and apply what we learn through hands-on labs using Jupyter Notebooks. By the end of this course, feel comfortable creating basic programs, working with data, and automating real-world tasks using Python.  

# Python Project for Data Science:
This mini-course is intended to demonstrate foundational Python skills for working with data. This course primarily involves completing a project in which we assume the role of a Data Scientist or a Data Analyst and are provided with a real-world data set and a real-world inspired scenario to identify patterns and trends. We perform specific data science and analytics tasks such as <b>extracting, web scraping, visualizing, and creating a dashboard</b>. This project showcases proficiency with Python and uses libraries such as Pandas and Beautiful Soup within a Jupyter Notebook. 


# Data Analysis with Python:
We learn how to import data from multiple sources, <b> clean and wrangle data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create meaningful data visualizations </b>. We then predict future trends from data by developing <b>linear, multiple, and polynomial regression models & pipelines and learn how to evaluate them. </b> We also practice hands-on labs and projects with several open-source Python libraries, including Pandas and Numpy to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. We also work with Scipy and Scikit-learn, to build machine-learning models and make predictions. 

# Data Visualization with Python:
One of the most important skills of successful data scientists and data analysts is the ability to tell a compelling story by visualizing data and findings in an approachable and stimulating way. In this course, we learn many ways to effectively visualize both small and large-scale data. We can take data that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that conveys insights. This course will teach you to work with many Data Visualization tools and techniques. We learn to create various types of basic and advanced graphs and charts like <b>Waffle Charts, Area Plots, Histograms, Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Scatter Plots, Word Clouds, Choropleth Maps </b>, and many more! We will also create interactive dashboards that allow even those without any Data Science experience to better understand data, and make more effective and informed decisions. We learn hands-on by completing numerous labs and a final project to practice and apply the many aspects and techniques of Data Visualization using Jupyter Notebooks and a <b>Cloud-based IDE</b>. We also use several data visualization libraries in Python, including <b>Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Plotly & Dash.</b>

# Applied Data Science Capstone:
In this course, we assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving <b> data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders</b>. We first predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, we focus on hands-on work to demonstrate and apply what you have learned in previous courses.
