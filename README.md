These courses include real-world projects using principal data science tools to apply your newfound skills.
Projects:

Extract and graph financial data with the Pandas Python library.

Wrangle data, graph plots, and create regression models to predict housing prices with Python libraries, including NumPy, and Sklearn.

Create visualizations and a dynamic Python dashboard with treemaps and line plots using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Dash to monitor, report, and improve US domestic flight reliability.

In the final capstone course, apply what weâ€™ve learned from previous courses into one comprehensive project. We will train and compare machine learning models, including support vector machines, classification trees, and logistic regression, to predict if a SpaceX launch can reuse the first stage of a rocket.
